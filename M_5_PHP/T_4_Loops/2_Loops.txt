Learning objective:

Loops in PHP

    -> do-while
    -> for
    -> foreach

do-while: it is even run once if condition is false in 1st time.

do{
    statement 
    ....
    ....
}while(condition);


for: For loop has 3 parts Initialization, Condition, Iteration.

foreach: It is special loop that is created only for arrays.

    foreach($array as $element){
        // code to excute multiple times
        ...
        ...
    }
    // code that  executes after the loop is over.
