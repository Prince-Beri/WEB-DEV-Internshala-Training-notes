    -> The web server searches for the PHP file on its computer and starts executing it.
    -> Data is converted into an associative array and is further stored in $_GET or $_POST 
    superglobal variables.
    -> The data is accessed using the superglobal variables.
        eg. $email = $_POST['email']; or $email = $_GET['email'];
    -> Data is stored in the database.


Method GET and POST:
    -> GET FROM: 
        -> The user data is visible in the URL which makes it less secure.
        -> The data is stored in $_GET superglobal variable.

    -> POST FORM:
        -> The user data is not visible in the URL which makes it secure.
        -> The data is stored in $_POST superglobel variable.
        -> Preferred in case of form submissions.
