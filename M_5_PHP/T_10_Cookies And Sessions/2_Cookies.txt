Learning objective:
    -> Explain cookies.
    -> Apply setcookie() to store cookies.
    -> Explain the problem associated with cookies.

Cookies: It is small piece of information stored in the browser of a user by
a website through some code. Cookie infromation is stored in the browser in the
form of key-value pairs.
    
    Cookies are website specific: 
        -> Every website store the cookies. for eg. when you goto some shopping website
        and add products to your cart but not buy them forget about them but when you login 
        again and you cart have the items that is you add previously that is because of Cookies.
    
    setcookie(): setcookie("key", "value", time() + 3600 <unix timestamp>);

    In PHP we have built-in superglobal variable: $_COOKIE['key'];
        eg. $value = $_COOKIE['key'];

    Problem with cookies: It is because it is accessable to user they can edit it.
    It is never used for login or to store critical infromation. 
        eg. we can store the non-critical infromation like last visited page by user its help the 
        website to redirect the user to last visited page automatically.
