Learning objective:
    -> Explain sessions.
    -> Apply the concept of sessions in PHP.

Session: It is a small piece of information stored on the server (host computer).

    eg. Let say there are 4 users who are viwing particular website so for every user
    website create a seprate sessions that is user specific and the data of the courponding 
    user is stored in there respative sessions we can see for every indivisual user the website have
    seprate user_id now each session has unique session id through which there sessions can be access 
    it is there session id's that are stored as cookies on the browser of each user.
    suppose all these user have close the website and they no longer viweing the website so now
    one of these user visites the website again the session id which is stored in browser as a cookie
    will go along with HTTP request that how cookie works and from the session id the host computer fetch 
    the coresponding session from that session it will fetch the stored user_id using which it can fetch other
    user related information from the database.

implementing Session in PHP: 
    -> session_start(): what happens when we call this function its expect the browser to send a cookie
     with the name "PHPSESSID" along with the HTTP request and this PHPSESSID contains a specific session id 
     the function uses it to fetch coresponding session assigns what every its contains to $_SESSION superglobal variable.
     using the $_SESSION variable we can access infromation stored in SESSION like this.
        eg. $_SESSION['user_id'] = 3; or $user_id = $_SESSION['user_id'];
    
Unable to locate PHPSESSID why?
    -> The user is visiting the website for the first time.
    -> The user has deleted the cookie from the browser.
    -> The user has edited the session id which does not match to the session stored on the server.
    -> The session stored in the server has expired or deleted.
    
    In such cases when the session_start() is not able to locate PHPSESSID cookie
    for which every mention reasion it will create new session the server and assign 
    what every is stores to $SESSION variable for it to be access by PHP code by default
    this session is empty $_SESSION variable can be use to store any new information in
    the session and as response go back the coresponding session id of session is stored 
    in user browser in the form of cookie with the name PHPSESSID this also insures that
    the next time when user open any web page on this website the Cookie with the name
    PHPSESSID storing the session id will definatlly come along with the HTTP request. 

Summary: 
    -> session_start() finds the session and assigns it to $_SESSION variable.
    -> Using $_SESSION variable without calling session_start() will throw an error.
        Note: For every request $_SESSOIN stores different session based on associated users 
        $_SESSION like a temprery variable the actual sessions are stored in file system on the 
        host computer.

    -> Note: As a good pratice we have to check  $_SESSION variable has any values that is set.
    for that we have $_isset() function.

    -> isset(): This function ensures the session has the user_id set and its not set to null only
    then it try to print the name(eg. example).

    -> session_destroy(): This function allow ous to delete the data of any session and the reasion 
    we use this function to delete the session of a user and makes the user log out from the account.

    Note: We have to first use the session_start() this is because to destroy any session we need to 
    first fetch the session courponding to user which is done by session start function if we first 
    defind the session_destroy() the file simply throw an error.
