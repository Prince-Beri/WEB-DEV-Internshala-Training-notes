Learning objective:
    -> Explain why global variables bhehave differently in PHP.
    -> Access a global variable from inside a function.
    -> Access a global variable using a predefined built-in associative array $GLOBALS.
    -> Explain superglobal variables.

why do global variables work differently in PHP?
    -> It is because we have sperate predefined associative array funcation 
    that help us to access the global variables. we cannot access the globla 
    variable directly.

How can we access a global variable from inside a function?
    -> Yes! we can access the global variables using key word 'global'.

$GLOBALS: It is a predefined built-in associative array.
    -> access global array variables: $GLOBALS['<variable_name>'];
    -> change the value of global variable: $GLOBALS['<variable_name>'] = value;

What is a superglobal variable ?
    -> It is a variable that is always avaliable in all scopes. This means, 
    it can be accessed from outside of a function or from inside of a function.
    -> They have a specific purpose.
    -> They are built-in and cannot be defined externally.
    -> They can be modified.
    -> They always exist as an associative array.
    -> As a  convention, they are named in capital letters.

Built-in associative arrays/ Superglobal variable:
    -> $_POST
    -> $_GET
    -> $_FILES
    -> $_REQUEST
    -> $_SERVER
    -> $_COOKIE
    -> $_SESSION
    -> $_ENV
