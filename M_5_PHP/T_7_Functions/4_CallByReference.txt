Learning objective:
    -> Call a function by reference.

Call by value: Till now we are using call by value approach to pass the values 
to function. Its make the duplicate copy of the variable is created changes to the one copy
of the variable inside the function don't effect the 2nd copy outside the function.
any changes has to expecitly return and store back in variable outside the funcation.

Call by reference: When we pass the argument to the function simply put '&' in
front of variable now we pass the variable to this function it will not create any duplicate 
copy rather the argument is point to the variable. any change to the argument will automatically
effect the variable being passed. we will not required return the change value
and store back outside.
