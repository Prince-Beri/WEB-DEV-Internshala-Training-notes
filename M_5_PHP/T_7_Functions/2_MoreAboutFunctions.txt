Learning objective:
    -> List various rules and conventions to name a function.
    -> Assign default values to function arguments.
    -> Explain the difference between a local and global variable.
    -> Explain the global variables with the help of an example.


Naming a function: Rules and conventions followed while naming a function.
    -> Can only contain alpha-numeric characters or the underscore.
    -> It cannot contain special characters like !, -, $ , etc.
    -> It cannot start with a number.
    -> Use an underscore if the name contains two or more words.
    -> Name should be self-explanatory.

Assigning default values to function arguments:
    -> 
    // function defination with default value.
    function get_max($a, $b = 0){
        if($a > $b){
            return $a;
        }else{
            return $b;
        }
    }

    // function calling with default value.
    $max = get_max(-5) . "";

    Note: if Defind the arguments value at function 
    calling part the function argument default value is egnored.

Scope of a variable.
    -> Locally (Local variable).
    -> Globally (Global variable).

    -> Local variable: Defined within a function.
        -> Their scope is limited to only inside of the function.

    Global variable: Defined Outside a function.
        -> Their scope is limited to only outside the function.
