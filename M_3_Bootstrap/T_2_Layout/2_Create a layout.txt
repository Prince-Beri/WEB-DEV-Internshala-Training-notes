Learniug objective:
    -> Apply breakpoints to create a layout.

Breakpoint chart: 

 Device             Range       Symbol      Breakpoint
  Mobile device      0-575                      >= 0
  Mobile landscape   576-767       sm           >= 576
  Tablet             768-991       md           >= 768
  Desktop            992-1199      lg           >= 992
  Xl  desktop        1200-1399     xl           >= 1200
  XXl desktop        1400-         xxl          >= 1400

eg. col-md-5:
    -> The breakpoint is always used in between 'col' and 'n'.
    -> It is used to specify after which point the column will be sized accordingly.
    -> The size of the column will be 5/12 for viweport >= 768 pixels.
    -> The width of the column will be 3/12 for all the devices with viewport >= 0 pixel.

Mobile first approach: It's means we start the from the mobile design view and then goto tablet and Laptop view.
