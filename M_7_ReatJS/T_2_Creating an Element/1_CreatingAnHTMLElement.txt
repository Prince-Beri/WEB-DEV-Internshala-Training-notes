Learning objectives:
    -> Create an HTML element using React.

createElement():
    -> React.createElement(): In react the name of the function is always precided by the library name
        inside which it is present.
        -> React: Library name.
        -> createElement(): Function name.

step 1. Create a React element / javascript object.
    eg. const heading = React.createElement(

    )

step 2. Pass the arguments to the function.
    const heading = React.createELement(
        'The 1st argument is a String that represent the type of HTML element we want to create.',
        'The 2nd argument is expacted to be a javascript object that contains all the attributes 
        that we want the HTML element to have ',
        'The 3rd argument is a String that represent the content go inside the element.'
        
        Note: we can also add the child element instead(as an alternative or subsitude) of "content" as a argument.
    );
    eg. const heading = React.createElement(
        'h1',
        {id: 'abc' },
        'This is a heading.'
    );

Creating an HTML element: render()
    -> It is used to render and display the react element object on the web page.

    ReactDOM.render(
        '1st argument is a react element OR the javascript object.',
        '2nd argument is HTML element from the DOM inside which we want to create this new element'
    );
    
    eg.
        ReactDOM.render(
            heading,

            document.getElementById('react-container')
        )


Creating multiple HTML elements using React
    -> eg.

            const heading = React.createElement(
                'h1',
                {id: 'abc'},
                'This is heading.'
            );

            const paragraph = React.createElement(
                'p',
                null,
                'This is a test paragraph which is created by React. This paragraph has no attribute and is contained inside a div which is also created by React.'
            );

            const box = React.createElement(
                'div',
                {className: 'box'},
                heading,
                paragraph
            );

            ReactDOM.render(
                box,
                document.getElementById("react-container")
            );
