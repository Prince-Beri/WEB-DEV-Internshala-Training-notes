Learning objectives:
    -> Create a class component.
    -> Add a state to the class component.

States: These are infomation associated with a component that allows us to create dynamic 
and interactive components.

Ways to create a component:
    -> Functional component: Stateless.
    -> Class component: Includes states.


Changing function component to class component.

        Functional component:
        eg.
        
        const Box = () => {
            return(
                <div className='box'>
                    <h1 id='abc'> {props.heading} </h1>
                    <p> This is a test paragraph which is created by React This paragraph has no attribute
                        and is contained inside a div which is also created by React.
                    </p>
                </div>
            );
        };

        Class component:
        eg.
        
        class Box extends React.Component {
            render(){
                return(
                    <div className='box'>
                        <h1 id='abc'> {this.props.heading} </h1>
                        <p> This is a test paragraph which is created by React This paragraph has no attribute
                            and is contained inside a div which is also created by React.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                );
            }
        }
    Note: There is no change in way we use or include our component.


Adding buttons to the component.
    -> class Box extends React.Component {
            render(){
                return(
                    <div className='box'>
                        <h1 id='abc'> {this.props.heading} </h1>
                        <p> This is a test paragraph which is created by React This paragraph has no attribute
                            and is contained inside a div which is also created by React.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <button>Red</button>
                    <button>Yellow</button>
                    <button>Blue</button>
                    <button>Green</button>
                );
            }
    }
Adding state to the component:
    -> class Box extends React.Component {
        state = {color: 'black' };
            render(){
                return(
                    <div className='box'>
                        <h1 id='abc'> {this.props.heading} </h1>
                        <p> This is a test paragraph which is created by React This paragraph has no attribute
                            and is contained inside a div which is also created by React.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <button>Red</button>
                    <button>Yellow</button>
                    <button>Blue</button>
                    <button>Green</button>
                );
            }
    }
