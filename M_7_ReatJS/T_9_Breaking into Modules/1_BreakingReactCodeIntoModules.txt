Learning objective:
    -> Break React code into modules.

ES modules:
    -> It is a feature allows to create individual javascript files called modules.

The idea is to keep each component in our case Box, Stats in different file and treat it as individual modules.
And when we use a component into another component we will have to expalicitly import that module into that module.

so how we can do that?
    -> In our case we have 3 components App, Box and Stats this means we will break this code into 
    3 modules one for each component.

    -> Now we have to make seprate file for each component.
        -> Box for box module.
        -> Stats for stats module.
        -> App for app module.
