Learning objectives:
    -> Install NodeJS on your system.
    -> Install Create React app locally.
    -> Create a React project folder using Create React app.

Untill now code which we writen in the app.js its is javascript extension or JSX code which is 
technically not a javascript code browsers don't understand this to help them understand we included 
a babel compiler in the form of a js file so that the browser can understand and run the JSX code.
So what the browser do its first convert the jsx code into javascript code that the browser can understand
using babel compiler and then it execute the converted javascript code to create the HTML elements.

Now what happeds is that size of the babel compiler file is aroung 800kb this means when ever the browsers
has to convert jsx into javascript code its need to load the file first.

Create React App:
    -> It creates an entire folder structure for our React project.
    -> It helps to maintain our code as the project grows.
    
Setting React project:
    -> First we need to install node js and npm to our computer.
    
    Create react app locally:
    -> After install node js and npm goto command prompt enter the command 
        "npm install -g create-react-app".
    Note: In new version of react you dont need to use this command. you can 
        execute next command directly.
    
    Create a React project folder using npx create-react-app.
    
    -> "npx create-react-app <name-of-react-app>".
