Learning objective:
    -> Understand and customize components using props.

Props:
    -> Props or properties of a component are information that can be passed to a 
        component. As we pass arguments to a function.

        Note: we can name a props as we like.

        eg. const App = () => {
            return (
                <div className='row'>
                <div className='col'>
                // here we passed props heading to the component as attribute to the custom component 
                tag the props are then  passed values as 'first heading' and 'second heading'.
                    <Box heading='first Heading' />
                </div>

                <div className='col'>
                    <Box heading='second Heading' />
                </div>
                </div>
            );
        }
Accessing the props: The props here is a object if we want to access it we can access it by
    using dot (.) operator.
        eg.
        const Box = (props) => {
            return (
                <div className='box'>
                <h1 id='abc' >{props.heading}</h1>
                <p> This is a test paragraph which is created by React This paragraph has no attribute
                    and is contained inside a div which is also created by React.
                </p>
                </div> 
            );
        }
