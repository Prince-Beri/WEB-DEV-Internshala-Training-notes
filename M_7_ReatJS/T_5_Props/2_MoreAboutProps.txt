Learning objective:
    -> Understand why props are uneditable.

Props are uneditable:
    -> This is because props are read-only and cannot be edited with in a component.

    -> Props are used by components to talk to each other and share information. But 
        information is passed only from a parent component down to a child component
        that's how data can flow. this gives parent component control on what data the
        child component should display.
            
        eg. like we can change info that we passed to the child components just at one 
            place. and it's changes the data to be displayed in UI inside those components.
            This also helps us work as a unit.
