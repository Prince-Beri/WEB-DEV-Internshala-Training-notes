Expressions in JSX: In JSX everything is expression if we put it inside curly brackets {} which

    eg.
        const name = 'Prince';
        const box = (
                <div className='box'>
                    <h1 id="abc">This is {name}'s heading</h1>
                    <p>
                        This is a test paragraph which is created by React. This paragraph has no attribute and is contained inside a div which is also created by React.
                    </p>
                </div>
            );

            ReactDOM.render(
                box,

                document.getElementById('react-container')
            );
