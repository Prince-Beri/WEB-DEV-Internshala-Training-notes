Learning objectives:
    -> Explain JSX.
    -> Create React elements using JSX.

JSX: It is an extension to the JS that is used with React to create HTML elements.
Note: For using JSX inside your browser you need Babel compiler that convert your JSX into
    JS so your browser can understand JS code which you write in JSX.
        -> add <script> tag.
            eg.
                <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
        
        -> Modify your <script> tag.
            eg. 
                <script type="text/babel" src="js/app.js"></script>
    eg.

        const box = (
            <div className='box'>
                <h1 id="abc">This is a heading</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a test paragraph which is created by React. This paragraph has no attribute and is contained inside a div which is also created by React.
                </p>
            </div>
        );

        ReactDOM.render(
            box,

            document.getElementById('react-container')
        );
