Learning objective:
    -> Understand how we can use arrow functions to create a component.


eg. const Box = () => {
    return (
        <div className='box'>
            <h1 id='abc' >This is a heading </h1>
            <p> This is a test paragraph which is created by React This paragraph has no attribute
                and is contained inside a div which is also created by React.
            </p>
        </div> 
    )
};

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div className='row'>
            <div className='col'>
                <Box />
            </div>

            <div className='col'>
                <Box />
            </div>
        </div> 
    )
}
