Learning objectives: 
    -> Flex-basis.
    -> Flex-grow.
    -> Flex-shrink.

flex-basis: It is applied to flex items.
    -> It i used to define the size of the item along the main axis.
    -> The default value is auto.
    -> It can defined any length value.
    -> The length overrides the width property even if explicitly defined.
    -> If flex-basis: auto and width: auto, then the value defined in width property is considered.

flex-grow: It is applied to flex items.
    -> Only applicable if the container has available space after placing all the flex items.
    -> Its default value is 0.
    -> It causes an item to stetch beyond its specified width in proprotion to other flex items as per their flex-grow values.

flex-shrink: It is applied to flex items.
    -> Only applicable if the container has deficit space.
    -> its default value is 1.
    -> It causes an item to shrink in proprotion to other flex items as per their flex-shrink values.
