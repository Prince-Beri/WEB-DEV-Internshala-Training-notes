Learingn objectives:
    -> Flex shorthand.
    -> Flex-wrap.
    -> Flex-flow.
    -> Justify-items.
    -> Align-items.
    -> Self-align.

Flex shorthand trick: 
    -> flex: (grow, shrink, basis);
       eg.flex: 0, 0, 200px;

flex-wrap: 
    -> It is applied to the flex container.
    -> It is applied only if the container has deficit space.
    -> It allows the browser to wrap the items together in another line 
        instead of shrinking them to fit in the same line.
    -> It has two values: wrap and nowrap.
    -> Its default value is nowrap.
    -> It does not affect the flex items when flex-wrap property value is set to wrap.

flex-flow: You can define the flex direction and flex flex-wrap into single line.
    -> flex-flow: row wrap;
       eg. flex-flow: flex-direction flex-wrap;
    -> It is applied to the flex container.

justify-content:
    -> It is applied to the flex container.
    -> It is applied only if the container has available space.
    -> It tells the browser how the available space should be distributed along the main axis, across the items.
    -> It works only if none of the flex items are allowed to grow.
    -> It has 6 values: flex-start, flex-end, center, space-around, space-between, and space-evenly.
    -> It default value is flex-start.

align-items:
    -> It is applied to flex container.
    -> It tells the browser how the items should be laid out along the cross axis.
    -> It has 4 values: stretch, flex-start, flex-end and center.
    -> It deafult value is stretch.

self-align:
    -> It is applied to individual flex items.
    -> It has 4 values: stretch, flex-start, flex-end and center.
    -> Its default value is stretch.
