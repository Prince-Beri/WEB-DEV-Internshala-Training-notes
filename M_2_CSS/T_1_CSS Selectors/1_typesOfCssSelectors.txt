selector { 
    property-1: value-1;
    property-2: value-2;
}
-> Selector is used to select one or more elements to which we want to apply the style.
-> Property means the CSS properties which we want to apply to the selector.
    Example: font-color, background-color, etc.
-> Values correspond to the specific style properties for the selected elements.

1. Elemnets/Type Selectors
    -> They are used to style all the elements of a particular type at once.

2. ID Selectors
    -> They are used to style only a single elements of a particular type.

    -> Naming conventions for unique ID
        1. It can have alphanumeric characters or hyphen or underscore.
        2. It cannot have any special characters.
        3. The name cannot start with a number.
3. Class Selectors 
    -> They are used when we want to style more than one element.

4. Combination Selectors (.)
    -> they are used when we want to style more than one element type of 
        elements but class apply to more then one elements.
    Example:
    
    <body>
        <h1 class="xyz"> this is a heading. <h1>
        <p class="xyz"> this is a paragraph with class xyz.</p>
        <p> this is a paragraph with no class.</p>
        <p class="xyz"> this is another paragraph with class xyz.</p>
    </body>

    so we want to select p element with class xyz.
    -> we have to use combination selector.
        -> p.xyz {
            color: red;
            background-color: skyblue;
        }
