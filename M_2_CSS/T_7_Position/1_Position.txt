Leaning Objectives: 
    -> Explain position CSS property.
    -> Explain static, relative, fixed, and absolute position property values.
    -> Apply z-index properties  to style a web page.

Position: It helps us to move HTML elements from their existing positions.
    -> It has 4 values: static, relative, fixed, and absolute.

    -> position: static
        -> Default value is different for different elements.
        -> Elements cannot be moved from their position.

    -> position: relative
        -> It helps move an HTML element with respect to its original position.
        -> position property have 4 different options top, right, bottom, left.
            -> eg. position: relative;
                   top: 50px;
                   left: 20px;
    
    -> position: fixed
        -> It moves the element with respect to the browser windows.
        -> The position of the element remains fixed even if we scroll the web page.
        -> The next element present after the positioned element takes the place of the positioned 
            element leaving no gap.

    -> position: absolute
        -> It moves the element with respect to the nearest positioned ancestor element.
        -> Nearest positioned ancestor element
            -> Ancestor: Ancestor means any element that is present up in the HTML hierarchy.
            -> Positioned: It means any element which has the position value other than the static.
                It means the nearst ancestor that has a non-static position value.
            

Z-index: It is used to position an element along the z axis.
    -> It is used mainly when there are overlapping elements and we want to explicitly put one elment over the other.
    -> Higher the z-index value of an element, the more close it is to us.
    -> It works only on positioned (non-static) elements.
