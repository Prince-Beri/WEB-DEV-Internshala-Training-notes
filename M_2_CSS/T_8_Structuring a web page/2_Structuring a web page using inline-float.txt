Learning objectives: 
    -> Explain the float CSS property.
    -> Create a wireframe using the float CSS property.

float: It places an element either on the left or right side of its container
       and allow the text and other elements to wrap around it.
    -> It has 3 values: left, right and none.
    -> The default value of float for any element is none.

Create a wireframe using float: 
    -> The approach is similar to display: inline-block.
    -> we use float: left instead of display: inline-block.
