Learning objective:
    -> List down diffrent types of JOIN queries.

In MySQL, there are three types of JOIN:
    -> INNER JOIN
    -> LEFT JOIN
    -> RIGHT JOIN
    
Here we have two tables students and companies students table 
stores the information(id, name, department, cgpa, company_id) about the 
students who study in the college. And the companies table store the information
(id, name, ctc, location) of the companies who come to college for placements.

And Students table also store the company_id denoting were the students has got
placed if students is not get placed any where then the comapny_id will be remain
Null.

INNER JOIN: 
-> SELECT * FROM students <left_table> INNER JOIN companies <right_table> 
    ON
    students.company_id = companies.id;

If we compare the data of this table with the previous table we can see that information
corsponding to "Sanjay" is  missing also records from companies table corspondes to "Google" 
and "Facebook" are also missing this is because we are use INNER JOIN now with inner join ONLY
THOSE RECORDS WHICH HAVE ATLEST ONE ASSOCIATED RECORDS IN OTHER TABLE ARE FETCHED.

For eg. "Ajay" is associated with "Samsung", "Rahul" is associated with "Microsoft" and so on.
but "Sanjay" has no company record associtated with him that is way record the corspondes to 
"Sanjay" is not fetched in INNER JOIN. Simlarly those companies which has associated records in 
Students table are fetched. Like samsung associated with "Ajay", Microsoft is associated wtih "Rahul"
so on but "Google" and "Facebook" are not associated with any record in students table and that is why
the records are corspond to them are not fetched. using the inner join.

LEFT JOIN:
    -> SELECT * FROM students LEFT JOIN companies 
        ON
        students.company_id = companies.id;
Here in the table we can see we have the 6th row extra row corsponding to the information of "Sanjay"
but still table does not include the record of "Google" and "Facebook" from companies table this is because
LEFT JOIN INCLUDES ALL RECORDS FROM LEFT TABLE IRRESPACTIVE OF WETHER THEY HAVE ANY ASSOCIATED RECORD
IN RIGHT TABLE. That is way it's include the record to corspond to "Sanjay" Even tho there is not record 
associatd with it in compaines table but for right table LEFT JOIN FETCHES ONLY THOSE RECORDS WHICH HAS 
HAS ATLEST ONE ASSOCIATED RECORD IN LEFT TABLE. that is way it's still does not include to records corsponding to
"Google" and "Facebook".

RIGHT JOIN:
    -> SELECT * FROM 
        students RIGHT JOIN companies
        ON
        students.company_id = companies.id;
    
Have look at last two rows it's now includes the records that corspondes to "Google" and "Facebook" 
from the companies table but it does not includes the records corspondes to "Sanjay" from the students table.
this because THE RIGHT JOIN INCLUDES ALL RECORDS FROM THE RIGHT TABLE IRRESPACTIVE OF WETHER THEY HAVE ANY ASSOCIATED 
RECORD IN LEFT TABLE that is way include the record corspond to "Google" and "Facebook" Even tho there is not record 
associatd with it in students table but for the left table RIGHT JOIN FETCHES ONLY THOSE RECORDS WHICH HAS 
HAS ATLEST ONE ASSOCIATED RECORD IN RIGHT TABLE.that is way it's does not include to records corsponding to
"Sanjay" from the students table.
