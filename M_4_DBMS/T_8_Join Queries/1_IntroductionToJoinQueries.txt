Learning objective:
    -> Apply JOIN queries to fetch data from a table.

Q. Get the job location of the Navjot from college1 data base where has 2 tabels students and companies.
    -> Get the company_id of Navjot from the students tables.
    -> Get the company records from the companies table using the company_id.
        
        Without JOIN Operation:
            -> SELECT company_id FROM students WHERE name = "Navjot";
            -> SELECT location FROM companies WHERE id = 4;

Join queries: 
    -> The idea is to VIRTUALLY COMBINE all the tabels in one table and fetch the data
    from the combine table in one go.
    If you look at combine table you will see name of the attributes
    (eg. students.id, stduents.name, companies.id, companies.name) as somthing (.) somthing
    this is because in join querie we refers to any attribute by it's table_name.attribute_name
    
    -> SELECT 
    companies.location FROM students INNER JOIN companies
    ON
    students.company_id = companies.id WHERE students.name = "Navjot";
