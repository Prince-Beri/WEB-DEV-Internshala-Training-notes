Learning objective:
    -> Explain what a foreign key is.

How to connect the records of two tables in a database?
    -> Foriegn key.

What is a foreign key?
    -> A foreig is an attribute in a table that refers to a primary key attribute
        of any other table. It can contain values only from the primary key attribute
        it is referring to and acts as a constraint.
    
    Naming convention: The foreign key should be named as the name of the table to
    which the foreign key is pointing to and the name should be in a sigular form.
    
    Foreign key syntax: Here we have 2 tables compaines, students we have to create
    compaines table first and then the students table this is because while creating 
    students table we will have to defind the company_id as a Froeign key and for this
    we will have to set the reference attribute which is the id attribute of the company table.
    so company table must be present before we create the students table.

    SQL queries for 'compaines' table.
    -> CREATE TABLE companies (
        id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        ctc VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY(id)
    )

    SQL queries for 'students' table.
    -> CREATE TABLE students (
        id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        cgpa FLOAT NOT NULL,
        company_id INT,
        PRIMARY KEY(id),
        FOREIGN KEY(company_id) REFERENCES companies(id)
    );
