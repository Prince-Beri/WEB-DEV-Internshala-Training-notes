Learning objective:
    -> Insert, Fetch, Update and Delete records from a table using SQL queries.

Insert : To add the data into table.
    -> INSERT INTO <table_name> (attribute_name1, attribute_name2, attribute_name3, attribute_name4)
        VALUES ("value1", value2, "value3");
        Example: INSERT INTO students (name, registration_number, gender)
                 VALUES ("Sourav", 123007, "Male");
        Note: we can add values into columns which we specify no_of_columns can be less then actual columns.  

    -> INSERT INTO <Table_name> VALUES (value1, "value2", value3, "value4", "value5");
        Example: INSERT INTO students VALUES (2, "Arpana", 123009, "Female", "CSE");
        Note: when we are use only INSERT INTO <table_name> VALUES we have to specify values to every column.

Fetching records from a table:
    -> Fetching all of the data at once. : SELECT * FROM students;
    -> Fetching specific data.
        -> WHERE: SELECT * FROM students WHERE compartment > 0;
        -> ORDER BY and ASC : SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY name ASC;
        -> UPDATE and SET: UPDATE students SET 
                           registration_number = 123010,
                           compartment = 3
                           WHERE s_no = 2;
        -> DELETE: DELETE FROM Students WHERE s_no = 2;

    how conditional statment write:
        -> attribute_name operator value;
        -> condition1 operator condition2;

    conditional signs
    > greater then.
    < less then
    = equal to
    != Not equal to 
    <= less then equal to
    >= greater then equal to
