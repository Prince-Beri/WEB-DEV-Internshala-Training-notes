Learning objective:
    -> Explain how the data is stored in a database.
    -> List down good practices to follow for creating a table to store data in a database.


data is store in database in the form of tables and the table have 2 things attributes and records.

Conventions or good practices follow while creating a table:
    -> Table name should be in lower case, example: students, faculties_cse, etc.
    -> Use plural form of noun while naming a table, example: students_cse, classrooms_cse, etc.
    -> If the table name contains more then one word, we should separate them using an undersore,
        example: students_cse, etc.
    -> Attributes name should be in lower case, example: name, designation, etc.
    -> Attributes name should be in a singular form, example: name, designation, etc.
    -> If the attributes name contains more then one word, we should separate them using an
        undersore, example: phone_number, etc.
    -> Add an additional attribute named 'id' in each table that contains auto incremented 
        integers. This attribute is also called the primary key of the table.
