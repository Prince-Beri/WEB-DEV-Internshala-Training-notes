Learning objective:
    -> Explain objects in JS.
    -> Create an object using JS.
    -> Access properties of an object using a dot (.) operator and square ([]) brackets.

Object: It is a data type.
    -> It is a collection of variables.
        eg. let dog = {
            // object variables is know as properties.
            breed: 'Golden retriever',
            height: '4ft.',
            age: 2,
            // function in objects referse as methods.
            display: function(){
                document.write("Breed of the Dog is: " + this.breed + " his height is: " + this.height + " and Age is: " + this.age + " Years.");
            }
        };
        dog.display();

Dot (.) operator: It is used to access the property or method of an object.
    -> It helps to assign a new value to an existing property.
        eg. dog.height = '4.5ft.';

    -> It helps to define a new property.
        eg. dog.weight = "32Kg";
    
Square [] brackets:
    -> It is used to access the properties of an object.
        eg. document.write(dog['breed']);
    
    -> It helps us to edit an existing property.
        dog['breed'] = 'Dalmatian';
    
    -> It helps us to define a new property.
        dog['color'] = 'white with black spots';
