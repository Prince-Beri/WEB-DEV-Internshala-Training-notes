Learning objective:
    -> Rest parameter with the help of an example.
    -> Spread operator with the help of an example.

Rest parameter:
    -> It allows us to collect an indefinite number of arguments passed to a function
    in the form of an array.
    -> It is denoted by the three dots (...) before a variable name.
    eg.
        function calculateSum (...args){
            let sum = 0;
            args.forEach(function(element){
                sum += element;
            });

            return sum;
        }

        let s = calculateSum(3, 5, 7, 9);
        document.write(s + " ");

Spread operator:
    -> It spreads or expands a variable into more than one.
    -> Also, it spreads an array into its elements.
    -> It is denoted by three dots(...) before a variable name.
    eg.
        // SPREAD OPERATOR(...)

        let odd = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];
        let even = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

        let numbers = [...odd, ...even];
        numbers.forEach(function(element){
            document.write(element + " ");
        });
        output: 1 3 5 7 9 2 4 6 8 10
