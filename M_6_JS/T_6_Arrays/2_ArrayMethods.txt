Learning objective:
    -> Explain foreach(), map(), and filter() with the help of example.

Array methods:
    -> push()
    -> pop()
    -> foreach():
        -> It is used as a loop but is not a loop.
        -> It is a function / method used to iterate through arrays.
        eg. const arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
        arr.forEach(function(element){
            document.write(element + " ");
        });
    -> map(): It is specific to array objects.
        -> It runs on an array and creates a new array.
            eg.
            let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
            // map return the new array 
            let square = numbers.map(x => x * x);

            square.forEach(function(element) {
                document.write(element + " ");
            });

    -> filter(): It is used to create a filter on the elements of an array based on
    the condition provided by the function.
        -> It creates a new array and assigns the returned values by the filter() to this array.
        eg.
            let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
            // filter return the new array 
            let even_numbers = numbers.filter(x => x * x % 2 == 0);

            even_numbers.forEach(function(element) {
            document.write(element + " ");
            });
