Learning objective:
    -> Explain strings.
    -> Define a string.
    -> Explain and use template literals.
    -> Explain strings as objects.

What are strings ?
    -> It is a text or a string of characters.
        eg. "123456", "abcdef", "abc123", etc.
    -> It is always enclosed within quotes ("").
    -> escape sequence removes the special meaning from the string.
        eg.
        
        let s = "Hello \"World\"!";
        document.write(s);

        output: Hello "World"!

    Concatenation: It means to link or join together.
        -> Concatenation operator in javascript is '+' sign.

Template literals:
    -> It is a string enclosed by a backtick (`).
    -> It allows us to print a variable within a string.
    eg.
        let name = "Joe";
        let s = `Hello ${name}!`;

        document.write(s);

String as objects:
    -> let str = new String("Hello World!");
    -> Length property: It helps us to identify the length of a string.
    -> The spaces and special characters are also included in the string length.
    -> so methods
        -> indexOf()
        -> slice()
        -> replace()
        -> startsWith()
        -> endsWith()
        -> include()
