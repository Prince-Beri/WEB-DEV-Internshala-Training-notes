Learning objective:
    -> Pass a function as an argument.
    -> Define a function using the arrow function.

Function as arguments:
    -> Function can be passed as an argument.
    -> The function passed to a function is called 'callback'.
        eg.
            let add = function(x, y){
            let s = x + y;
            return s;
        }

        let a = 5, b = 20;

        function action(x, y, z){
            let r = z(x, y);
            return r;
        }

        let r = action(a, b, add);
        document.write(r);

Arrow functions:
    -> It is an alternate way to define a function.
        eg. 
            let multiply = (x, y) => {
                let p = x * y;
                return p;
            };
    -> It's farther be shorten. It's depends on 2 conditions.
        -> It can have alphanumeric characters or hyphen or underscore
            let multiply = (x, y) =>  x * y;
            Note : we remove the {} and return statement.

        -> Function has only one argument.
            let multiply = x => x * x;
            Note: we can also remove argument brackets ().
