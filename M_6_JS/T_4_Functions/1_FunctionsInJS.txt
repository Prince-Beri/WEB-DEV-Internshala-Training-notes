Learning objective:
    -> How we can pass aruments to a function by a value.
    -> Anonymous function with the help of an example.

Function: Is is a block of code that performs a specific task.
    -> It takes data to perform tasks called 'function aguments'
    -> It can take any number of arguments.
    -> It returns only one value at a time.

    function has 2 parts : 
        -> function defination 
            eg.
                function get_max(a, b){
                    if(a > b){
                        return a;
                    }else{
                        return b;
                    }
                }
        -> function calling.
            eg. 
                let max = get_max(5, 10);
                document.write(max);
        
    
    Call by value / reference.
        -> It allow us to pass arguments to a function.
        -> In JS, we can pass arguments to a function using only call by value.

    Summary:
        -> For arrays and objects, if we change the argument variable itself, the 
        original variable remains unaffected.
        -> It we change the internals of the argument variable, the original variable also gets changed.
        -> The concept of call by value is the same for objects as well.
    

    Anonymous function:
        -> These are the function that do not have any name.
            eg. 
                let multiply = function (x, y){
                    let p = x * y;
                    return p;
                };

                let r = multiply(5, 10);
        -> They are mainly used in objects.
