Learning objective:
    -> Define a variable using 'let' , 'var' and 'const'.
    -> List down the differences between 'let', 'var', 'const'.
    -> List down various naming conventions followed while naming a variable.


Defining / Declaring a Variable:
    -> let : Newly introduced in 2015.
    -> var: Old way of declarnig a variable.
    -> const: It is used to declare a constant variable whose value cannot be changed.

    let: let = "Hello World!"; assigning data to a variable using equals to operator(=).
    Note: We cannot declare the same variable twice in the code.


let vs var :
    -> let: It has a block level scope.
        -> Same variable cannot be declared twice.        
        -> The variable needs to be initilized.

    -> var: It has a function or global scope. 
        -> We variable can be declared twice.
        -> No need to initialize the variable.

    strict: abc = "Hello World!"; document.write(abc); here we don't declare the variable.
    but we are using it. To prevent that we use "use strict" like this in our code.


Naming conventions:
    -> Contain alphanumeric characters, underscore, and dollar.
        eg. _abc, $abc, abc123, etc.
    -> Cannot start with a number.
        eg. 123abc, 123_abc, etc.
    -> Cannot contain special characters like !, -, #, etc.
    -> Case sensitive. eg. abc, ABC both are different variables.
