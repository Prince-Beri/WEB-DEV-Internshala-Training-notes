Learning objective:
    -> The importance of javascript.
    -> The execution of a javascript file.
    -> How we can use a javascript file inside an HTML file.

What is Javascript ?
    -> Javascript is a loosely typed scripting language it's mean this language can be execute directly 
    without any precompilation unlike the case of java and c++ etc. Javascript is a client side
    scripting language like HTML. Which mean the web server simplly sends a javascript files to 
    browser as response without even bothring to konw what the file contains.
    

What is the need of Javascript ?
    -> Javascript is use to make interactive web pages by interactive we mean it react to human actions.
        
        -> It is used to capture user actions on a web page. like click the button, hovering the mouse on something
        , or pressing any key on keyboard. All these actions save as javascript events.

        -> It gives  us flexibility to edit the HTML elements after they have been loaded by the browser.
        eg. when we click on some element the content of element changes.

        
How can we use Javascript ?
    -> It is like other language(HTML(.html), CSS(.css), PHP(.php)) we save the file with (.js) extension.
    we can javascript file into HTML file with script tag. script tag has 2 attributes type and src.
    type tell the type of  file is javascript and src tell the where is the file located.

        -> eg. <script type="text/javascript" src="js/script.js">

    
Execution a Javascript file:
    -> we know javascript files added into body tag of HTML code so then the browser start the rendring the code
    Its encounters the script tag which is basically for the js file. This initiates a new HTTP Request to fetch the 
    assocated javascript file and once the javascript file is fetched send to the browser(Response) It is then render
    by the browser. javascript files not fecthed along with HTML files they fecth by the browser will rendering the code.
