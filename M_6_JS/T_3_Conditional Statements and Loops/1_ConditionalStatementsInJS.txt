Learning objective:
    -> Apply different conditional statements in a javascript code.

Conditional statements:
    -> if.
    -> if else.
    -> if-elseif-else: In PHP we use "elseif" as single word but in js we use 
        "else if" with a space between them that is the only difference.
    -> switch.
