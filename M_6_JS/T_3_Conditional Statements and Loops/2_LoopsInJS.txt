Learning objective:
    -> Apply different loops in a Javascript code.
    -> Explain for-of, for-in loops in JS.
    -> Explain foreach function in JS.

Loops: 
    -> while loop: same as we learn in PHP.
    -> do while loop: same as we learn in PHP.
        Note : do while vs while 
            -> The condition is checked at the exit point instead of the entry point.
            -> The code block is still executed even if the codition fails for the very 1st time.
    
    for-of loop: It is same as foreach loop in PHP.
        eg. 
            "use strict";
            const arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
            for(let element of arr){
                document.write(element);
            }

    for-in loop: It is used for javascript objects.
        eg. 
            "use strict";
            const obj = { George: 2001, Barack: 2009, Donald: 2017 };
            for(let name in obj){
                document.write(name + " got elected in " + obj[name]);
            }

    foreach loop: It is used as a loop but not a loop.
        -> It is a function.
        -> It is used to iterate through arrays.
        eg. 
            "use strict";
            const arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
            arr.forEach(function(element){
                document.write(element + " ");
            });
